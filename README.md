# Daily-Range-Before-and-After-Earnings-Announcement
Edward O. Thorp, the mathematician, originial balckjack card counter and later successfull hedgefund manager, talked about waiting for rich opportunities before he took on risk. Large daily ranges are rich opportunities which explains why I always did well trading during earnings seasons. I wanted to visualize the expansion in range after an earnings announcement. I choose the companies in sp500 somewhat arbitrarily and I choose 2012-2019 because those were low volitilty years and I didn't want the broader market volatility affecting the results.
