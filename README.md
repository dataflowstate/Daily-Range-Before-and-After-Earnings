# Daily-Range-Before-and-After-Earnings-Announcement
Edward O. Thorp, the mathematician, original Blackjack card counter and later successful hedge fund manager, emphasized waiting for rich opportunities before he took on risk. Large daily ranges are rich opportunities which explains why I always did well trading during earnings seasons. I wanted to visualize the expansion in range after an earnings announcement. I chose the companies in sp500 somewhat arbitrarily and I chose 2012-2019 because those were low volatilty years where the broader market volatility would not affect the results.
